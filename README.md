## Idea

Note: This is not a replacement of your usual chat application. This will allow two mututally agreed users to have a conversation with most privacy and annonimity. The app itself doesn't track you or ask any infromation from you.

Your data is owned by **only you** and **only while chatting**.

### Key Features: 
1. The end users are not tracable.
2. Data are not stored on any remote server.
3. No saved history i.e. once chat is closed the data is not recoverable. 
4. It doesn't ask any information from you -- no login/singup.


### Technology: 
Whisper (Backed by Enhereum - blockchain). 

### How to initiate chat:  
1. Generate unique link and passkey.
2. Share the link and passkey with the one you want to chat with.  
3. Both users identify themselves with the passkey.
4. You start chatting through ethereum.

### Why it's not tracable?
Your data goes through ether and we don't store any information on server. Know more: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper
